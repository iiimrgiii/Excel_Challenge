# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project

-The overview of the project was to help Louise to launch a play and how we can do it with the highest chance of success. We were able to look at and clearly see the time of year we needed to launch to project to have the best chance of success, as well as we were able to clearly see budget information to best help.

### Purpose

-The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise to know when the best time to launch her Kickstarter campaign for her upcoming play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

-The challenges the campaign could face is going for too high of a budget, but that can be lessen by the timing the launch correctly. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-Time of year makes a large difference on the chances of success, but overall Play campaigns do have good chance of success, especially if you know how to target and time it correctly.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

-I think the outcome of the goal was a success. It was very clear that we were able to give them the answers they were looking for, as well as we have some infomation on how we can continue to help them by giving them even more details on the type of play they could work on to launch.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-Biggest challenege of the Module challenge was configuring the Outcome Based Goals Line Graph. To figure out what data to keep out of it was tricky. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

-The chance of success is much higher depending on the time of year. The chance of launching a successful campaign is best between May and August, the rest of the year you have a significantly decreased chance of launching a play campaign in the time outside of that. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

-Youre typically going to have a larger chance of success with a lower goal amount. The chances decrease dramatically from 20k to 35k but have an uplift between 40k to 45k. So I would recommend either going for a budget production. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

-Some limitations to the data set to get an even clearer idea of what kind of play they should do is, such as theme.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

-You could do another line graph similar to that in the Outcome Based On Goals for the summer to see what is a good budget/goal to go for, as they have the highest amount of successful campaigns.
