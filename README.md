# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

-The purpose of this analysis was to help Louise to know when the best time to launch her Kickstarter campaign for her upcoming play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The challenges the campaign could face is going for too high of a budget, but that can be lessen by the timing the launch correctly. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-Time of year makes a large difference on the chances of success, but overall Play campaigns do have good chance of success, especially if you know how to target and time it correctly.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

-Biggest challenege of the Module challenge was configuring the Outcome Based Goals Line Graph. To figure out what data to keep out of it was tricky. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

-The chance of success is much higher depending on the time of year. The chance of launching a successful campaign is best between May and August, the rest of the year you have a significantly decreased chance of launching a play campaign in the time outside of that. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

-Youre typically going to have a larger chance of success with a lower goal amount. The chances decrease dramatically from 20k to 35k but have an uplift between 40k to 45k. So I would recommend either going for a budget production. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

-Some limitations to the data set to get an even clearer idea of what kind of play they should do is, such as theme.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

-You could do another line graph similar to that in the Outcome Based On Goals for the summer to see what is a good budget/goal to go for, as they have the highest amount of successful campaigns.
